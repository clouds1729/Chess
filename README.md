# Chess Engine Project

This is a chess engine project that combines C++ code and the Stockfish chess engine to create a powerful chess playing application.

## Features

- Integrated Stockfish chess engine for strong chess evaluation and move generation
- Interactive command-line interface to play against the chess engine
- Supports loading and saving game states in the standard Portable Game Notation (PGN) format
- Configurable search depth and evaluation parameters to fine-tune the engine's performance
- Easy-to-use code structure for extensibility and further development

## Technologies Used

- C++ for the core chess engine logic and user interface
- Stockfish chess engine for advanced chess evaluation and move generation
- Git for version control and collaboration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-engine.git`
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) and the Stockfish executable installed.
3. Build the project using your preferred C++ build tool (e.g., CMake, Make).
4. Run the chess engine application and enjoy playing against the AI opponent!
